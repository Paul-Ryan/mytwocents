              If you’re a frequent user of Google’s Image search, 
              then you probably noticed that the company recently removed 
              the ‘View Image” button from search results.

              The button would allow you to look at a full-size version of a 
              photo without having to visit the page where it’s published. 
              For instance, you might be able to look at the big picture of a 
              laptop I posted above without ever seeing this post that it’s attached to.

              It was useful if you wanted to snag a picture to use for something 
              like your desktop background or the top of a Facebook event, but it 
              also caused a good deal of copyright infringement, leading Google to 
              remove the option thanks to a new deal it made with Getty Images.
              If you were a frequent user of the feature, you can still get a 
              similar experience through another search engine: Startpage.

              The browser is focused on privacy and provides Google’s 
              search results but with no targeted ads and more privacy. 
              Also, as Ghacks notes, it still has a “View Image” button that 
              can be used exactly how the old one was on Google proper.

              If you’re one of the many missing the feature, then it’s 
              definitely worth a look.
