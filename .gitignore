# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
./bundle*


# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

/node_modules
/yarn-error.log

.byebug_history
.DS_Store
npm_debug.log


# Ignore python virtual environment
/mtc_venv


# Django ignore

# If you need to exclude files such as those generated by an IDE, use
# $GIT_DIR/info/exclude or the core.excludesFile configuration variable as
# described in https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
